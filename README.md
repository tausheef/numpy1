# ðŸ“Š Learning NumPy

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **NumPy**, the core library for numerical computing in Python.

Iâ€™ve worked on real questions to understand concepts like:
- Array creation and manipulation
- Indexing, slicing, and filtering
- Broadcasting and arithmetic operations
- Matrix operations and conditional updates

All solutions are written in a clean and beginner-friendly way.  
Feel free to explore, try the problems, or contribute!

ðŸ”— Ideal for beginners who prefer learning by doing.
